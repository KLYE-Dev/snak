Updated for Hive Smart Chain (HSC) v0.18.0
This document has inspired by truffle README.md

hsc-helper-cli is a node.js app which already is under development, aiming to facilitate working with Hive Smart Chain (HSC) without using Monax.

### with hsc-helper-cli you will have these facilities:

* Easily install and uninstall Hive Smart Chain (HSC).
* Built-in smart contract compilation, linking, deployment.
* Having interaction with blockchain(Burrow) directly via linux terminal.
* Automated contract testing with Mocha and Chai(will be added in future).
* Network management for deploying to many public & private networks.
* Interactive console for direct contract communication(will be added in future).

### Install

```
$ npm install -g hsc-helper-cli
```

### Quick Usage
```
Install Burrow
(for now only Ubuntu 16.04 amd64 and Darwin are supported)
will copy Burrow necessary files in the '$HOME/burrow'

$ hsc-helper-cli install_node
This command will install Hive Smart Chain (HSC) on the $/HOME/burrow and by default use the http://localhost:1337/rpc.
You can find a predefined accounts on this directory.
```
```
Uninstall Burrow
This command will delete the '$HOME/burrow'

 $ hsc-helper-cli uninstall_node

```
```
Run Burrow

 $ hsc-helper-cli start
 This command at first run the Monax_keys on the default port and then will run the Burrow.
 Please be sure that before running Burrow, import the keys  which already are located in the burrow installation directory.
 $ hsc-helper-cli import_keys $HOME/burrow/account_list.json

```

```
Send random transaction
$ hsc-helper-cli rtx <count>

This command uses the pre-defined acounts to send the random amount transactions between these accounts!
```
```
Send transaction

$ hsc-helper-cli send <priv_key> <address> <fee>

```

For a default set of contracts and tests, run the following within an empty project directory:

```
Initialize project:

$ hsc-helper-cli init
```

From there, you can run `hsc-helper-cli compile`, `hsc-helper-cli migrate` and `hsc-helper-cli test`(will be implemented in future) to compile your contracts, deploy those contracts to the network, and run their associated unit tests.

```
Compile smart contracts:

$ hsc-helper-cli compile

it will compile all the contracts which are already inside the contract folder and makes the Bytecodes and ABIs and put them in the build directory.
```
```
Deploy smart contracts:

$ hsc-helper-cli migrate [accountname]

[accountname] is optional, if you do not want to use default account you can save your account in a standard account json file in the accounts folder and name it 'account.json'.

```
Be sure you launch the Burrow using `$hsc-helper-cli run_burrow` and put all contracts on the contract folder before running these commands.

```
Call smart contract's functions:

$ hsc-helper-cli call <contract_name> <function_name> <parameters_list>

The parameters are pretty clear the only thing you need to care is parameters_list, its formar must be like this:   var1,var2,...,varK (comma separated)

```

```
